# Land Cover Map Template

This repository contains a template for a Shiny application that displays a simple map, which shows 2019 Land Cover from the USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD). More information about the 2019 Land Cover dataset is available at: <https://www.mrlc.gov/data/nlcd-2019-land-cover-conus>

***NOTE:** The NLCD layer is turned off by default. It has to be turned on by clicking the box labeled "Land Cover (2019 NLCD)" in the layers selection pane (in the upper right corner of the map).*
